1. Connect a jumper wire to 5V pin and GND pin in Arduino from the power headers.
    - Make sure to use the dedicated Power OUT headers (they are next to each other, between 3.3V and GND pins)

2. Connect the jumper wires to the breadboard
    - Connect 5V to positive and GND to negative.

3. Connect both power rails in the breadboard:
    -  Connect another pair of jumper wires immediately below the first into positive and negative rails
    -  Connect the pair to the other side of the breadboard, match posiitve to positive and negative to negative.
